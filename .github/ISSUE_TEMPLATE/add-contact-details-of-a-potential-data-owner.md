## What works well to get new data become publicly available
In order to find relevant data, it helps to reach out to the relevant organisations and their employees to let them know that open-sourcing their data would benefit the electricityMap and the world. Below, you can input the publicly available contact details of relevant organisations to allow our community to reach out to them. 

## Relevant area:
Find the relevant zone by clicking on the zone on electricityMap and replace this paragraph by the zone identifier. For example: for Nigeria, the URL is https://www.electricitymap.org/zone/NG thus the zone identifier is NG.
